# EmbeddedPython

This is a .NET wrapper for Python 2 and Python 3 written in C#.

It somehow similar to Python .NET project with exception that it enforces more type safety and abstracts Python even further, so that more CLR native objects used instead.

Project is fully covered with Unit Test, including stress tests to ensure no memory leaks on Python side are introduced.
